# Arma 3 / CSWR: Automatizing the War v7.2
>*Dependencies: none.*

CSWR is an Arma 3 script that allows you to spawn AI groups and vehicles how and wherever you want, making them automatically move through the easily defined map regions without the need for scripting knowledge. CSWR almost doesn't change original AI behaviors, saving server performance and Arma 3 integrity.

Special thanks: To the old "T8 Units" script for the inspiration over the years.

## QUICK START

**Steps for Basic Editors:**
- 1 - Download and open the documentation;

## CHANGELOG

**Jan, 18th 2025 | v7.2**
- **IMPORTANT 1:** the script folder inside the mission as renamed from "CSWRandomizr" to "CSWR";
- **IMPORTANT 2:** the 1_Management, 2_Population and 3_Loadout files received a prefix number in their names to help editors to get the best sequence of file edition;
- **IMPORTANT 3:** the description.ext code was updated;
- Added > Helicopters > Through Population file, with helicopters use destination-type "_move_EXTRACTION" to schedule a extration that always bring you to the base (helicopter spawn-point);
- Added > Helicopters > Through Population file, with helicopters use destination-type "_move_TRANSPORT" to request an air transport to take your group to another area of your choice;
- Added > Helicopters > New helicopter class supported: Medium class with their own altitude (medium altitude editable too, perfect for transport/extraction helicopters);
- Added > Spawn delay > Just like 'by Trigger', 'by Object Target' and 'by Timer', now you can spawn something using 'Boolean flag', perfect for external scripts or codes with triggers;
- Added > Groups > One more formation options (three in total) for BluFor, OpFor, and Independent. Civilian still with two options;
- Added > Loadout customization > Now you can select two or more uniforms, for example, for infantry and randomize them automatically, perfect to create militia and PMC factions;
- Added > Vehicle cargo items > In Management file, the option 'CSWR_removeItemsCargo', if true, removes all cargo items from vehicles spawned by CSWR;
- Fixed > Coding > Two global variables weren't declared correctly, causing log error messages for servers;
- Fixed > Spawns > CSWR anti-spawn-blockers was deleting even the Player's AI members if they were over a vehicle spawn-point position. For those objects, only a warning message;
- Fixed > Spawns > CSWR anti-spawn-blockers was deleting custom helipads (those placed by you);
- Tweaked > Ethnicity > People from Civilian doesn't use camo face paint anymore, no matter what ethnicity is chosen;
- Improved > A few performance improvements;
- Documentation has been updated.

**Dec, 29th 2024 | v7.0**
- **IMPORTANT 1:** from now and so on, the sector-letter is needed (not an option anymore) in spawns and destinations. Example of spawn, from 'cswr_spawn_blu_1' to 'cswr_spawn_blu_A_1';
- **IMPORTANT 2:** from now and so on, vehicles are not allowed to spawn through infantry spawn-points. Vehicles should use only 'spawnveh' or 'spawnheli' or 'spawnparadrop';
- Added > Spawn type > Support to nautical spawns, allowing spawn boats and other nautical vehicles, including ground vehicles with amphibious ability;
- Added > Identity > Select the ethnicity each side represents, changing their faces and language automatically: Africa, Asia, Europe, Eastern Europe, Mid-East, North America, South America;
- Added > Option to turn off the entire script through the management file, no need to touch the description.ext anymore;
- Improved > Marines > Now, all infantry that spawn in water is converted automatically to a marine that has its own loadout if the editor customized that in 'fn_CSWR_loadout.sqf' file;
- Improved > How each group/vehicle chooses its 'time breaking' before each new waypoint;
- Improved > The spawn-points feedback when dropped in inappropriate places (ground vehicle spawns too far away from the shore);
- Improved > Paradrop > Now you can control the spreading (radius) of parashooters and vehicles falling from the sky where the minimal spreading is 200 meters and the default is 500;
- Improved > Paradrop > Rock mountains > If a parashooter leader falls over a rock, CSWR manages to reposition them in a safe ground aside where they will wait for the group members to regroup;
- Improved > Paradrop > Rock mountains > If a parashooter member gets stuck or too late to regroup their leader position, after a while (editable), CSWR teleports the unit to the leader position;
- Improved > Paradrop > Water/sea > If a parashooter leader falls into the water, CSWR manages to reposition them in near the coast where they'll wait for the group members to regroup;
- Improved > Paradrop > If a leader dies during the regroup waiting, CSWR transfers the waiting responsibility to the new group leader if applicable;
- Improved > Amphibious vehicles (e.g. APC) can only spawn in water and move to the land, but no longer move in move-markers IN the water, preventing accidental disengaging;
- Improved > Helicopters > If it's spawned in water, the helicopter automatically starts its mission hovering;
- Improved > Helicopters > The crew now is using the custom infantry uniform too, but without changing helmet and/or goggles;
- Improved > Destinations > Now, each group/vehicle has its own waypointCompletionRadius each new destination, making units and vehicles more spread out when simultaneously in the same place;
- Improved > init.sqf file updated;
- Improved > A bunch of performance improvements;
- Improved > fn_CSWR_population.sqf > Group variable names have been changed to be more readable/easy to understand;

- Fixed > Single player > Before, if you turned off the Debug mode and tried to run a single-player game, an error about CSWR_prefix was printed out;
- Fixed > Markers > If editor has a typo in some marker prefix ("cswr_") the script tells them correctly;
- Fixed > Paradrop > An issue where paradropped vehicles would sometimes lose their balance and flip over in mid-air, causing the crew's death or the vehicle to crash upon landing;
- Fixed > Spawn delay > The bug that a group doesn't spawn if the editor sets the spawn-delay-timer to 0 (zero) minutes. Now zero and negative numbers are ignored;
- Fixed > Destinations > If all hold-destinations are booked, tracked-vehicles were traveling through the map instead of taking a peripherical position onto booked hold-position;
- Fixed > Group behavior > Some infantry groups (when their behavior were "SAFE") were not in diamond formation, which is mandatory for infantry executing hold-position;
- Fixed > Helicopters > If a chopper needs repair/rearm/refuel/heal but no land-helicopter-spawn available, now the helicopter ignores the RTB necessity and fights 'til death;
- Tweaked > Snipers > Now, if you turn (e.g.) CSWR_canNvgSnipersBLU to "false", no matter if the sniper group is part of paratroopers that NVG is allowed, the sniper group won't receive NVG anymore;
- Tweaked > Helicopters > When the helicopter spawn landed, now it will turn the engine immediately but it still has a cooldown before take-off;
- Tweaked > Helicopters > Light class ones have a new default operational altitude (from 150 to 300 meters of altitude);
- Tweaked > Helicopters > Heavy class ones have a new default operational altitude (from 300 to 600 meters of altitude);
- Removed > Paratroops > Goggles are not a mandatory gear anymore;
